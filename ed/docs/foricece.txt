Preparation of Papers in Two-Column Format for 
ICECE

First A. Author and Second B. Author (authors' names)




   Abstract ? These instructions give you basic guidelines for 
preparing camera-ready papers for ICECE (International 
Conference on Engineering and Computing Education), Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, August 9-12, 1999.  Do not cite references in the 
abstract. Indent this paragraph. Use a long dash after the words 
"Abstract" and "Index Terms".  The abstract should not exceed 
100 words. Avoid using abbreviations in the title, in case they 
are necessary, do write their meaning in the abstract. Please 
carefully follow the instructions provided in this format to 
ensure legibility and uniformity.

   Index Terms ? Preparation of papers, camera-ready, two-
column format,  IEEE format.

I. INTRODUCTION

    This format simulates the usual appearance of typeset 
papers in the IEEE journals. For items not addressed in these 
instructions, please refer to recent issues of IEEE journals. 
Prepare your camera-ready paper on 8« in ? 11 in or A4 
paper. Use Times Roman serif typeface. Do not use a dot-
matrix printer. The minimum and maximum number of pages 
are three and five, respectively. 

A. Paper Preparation

   1) Format: In formatting your page, set the top margin to 
19 mm (0.75 in) and the left margin to 18 mm (0.7 in). If you 
are using 8« in ? 11 in paper, set the right margin to 18 mm 
(0.7 in) and the bottom margin to 19 mm (0.75 in). If you are 
using A4 paper, set the right margin to 12 mm and the bottom 
margin to 37 mm.  This gives a column length of 24 cm (9.5 
in). The column width is 88 mm (3.45 in). The space between 
two columns is about 5mm (0.2 in).  Paragraph indentation is 
about 3.5 mm (0.14 in).
   Left - and right - justify your columns. Use two columns in   
all pages, always. The two columns must always exhibit 
equal lengths and you should try to fill your last page as 
much as possible. To obtain such results, you are free to 
adjust the figures size provided this does not compromise 
their clarity. Do not use a line of space between paragraphs. 
Use one line of space between text and section headings. Use 
one or two lines of space between text and captions, 
equations, tables and footnote. Use automatic check spelling 
and hyphenation.

II. HELPFUL HINTS

   Avoid placing figures and tables before their first mention 
in the text. Use the abbreviation  "Fig." even at the beginning 
of a sentence.

   Do not abbreviate "Table"; use Roman numerals to number 
tables. Refer simply to the reference number, as [3] or [5]-[8]. 
Do not use "Ref. [3]" or "reference [3]" except at the 
beginning of sentence: "Reference [3] shows..". Provide up 
to five authors' names; replace the others by "et al.".  
Number equations in parenthesis flush with the right margin, 

                 2jk ?u/?z  =  ?2u/?x2 + k2 (n2 - ?2) u .                  (1)

Refer to "(1)", not "Eq. (1)" or "Equation (1)", except at the 
beginning of a sentence: "Equation (1) is.". Appendixes, if 
needed, appear before the acknowledgment, which in turn 
appears before the last section of the paper: References. Do 
not put figures or anything else after the references. Do not 
number appendix, acknowledgment and reference sections.
